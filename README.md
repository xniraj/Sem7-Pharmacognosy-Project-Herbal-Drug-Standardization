### **Introduction**  
This repository contains the research work and final report for the Pharmacognosy project conducted during Semester 7. The project focuses on **Herbal Drug Standardization**, addressing challenges such as variability in plant sources, regulatory gaps, and quality control. The work includes practical experiments like phytochemical screening, extraction methods (Soxhlet, TLC, HPLC), and formulation of herbal syrup.

### **Project Highlights**  
- **Objective**: Ensure consistent quality, safety, and efficacy of herbal medicines through standardization.  
- **Key Topics**:  
  - Challenges in herbal drug standardization (e.g., inter-species variation, environmental factors).  
  - Methods: Botanical authentication, phytochemical analysis, chromatographic techniques, stability testing.  
  - Formulation and evaluation of an anti-diabetic herbal syrup.   

### **Files Included**  
1. `Herbal-Drug-Standardization_Presentation.pdf`  
   - Research presentation on challenges and solutions in herbal drug standardization.  
2. `Pharmacognosy-Report_2023-24.pdf`  
   - Final report detailing methodologies, experiments, and outcomes.  

### **How to Use**  
1. Clone the repository or download the PDFs directly.  
2. Refer to the presentation for an overview of standardization challenges and regulatory frameworks.  
3. Explore the final report for detailed methodologies (e.g., Soxhlet extraction, TLC analysis) and herbal syrup formulation.  

### **Technologies/Tools**  
- **Analytical Techniques**: HPLC, TLC, UV spectroscopy.  
- **Extraction Methods**: Soxhlet, maceration, steam distillation.
